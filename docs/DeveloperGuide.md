### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Find command

#### Overview
The `find` feature enables insurance agents to search for clients flexibly using multiple keywords and attributes.  
It extends the base AB3 `FindCommand` by supporting **case-insensitive**, **partial matching** across multiple fields: **name**, **phone**, and **email**.

#### Key classes
* `FindCommand` — Executes the search by calling `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(predicate)`.
* `FindCommandParser` — Tokenizes user input and constructs the predicate.
* `ClientMatchesPredicate` — Implements `Predicate<Person>` and encapsulates all matching logic.

#### Behavior
1. User inputs a command such as `find alex 9223`.
2. `LogicManager#execute()` delegates the command string to `AddressBookParser`.
3. `AddressBookParser` recognizes the command word `find` and instantiates a `FindCommandParser`.
4. `FindCommandParser` tokenizes the keywords (`["alex", "9223"]`) and constructs a `ClientMatchesPredicate` object (`p`) that:
    - Ignores blank keywords.
    - Performs **null-safe** access to person fields.
    - Returns `true` if **any** keyword appears in the person's name, phone, or email.
5. A new `FindCommand` object is created with `p` and executed by the `LogicManager`.
6. During execution, `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(p)` is invoked.
7. The model filters the in-memory client list using `ClientMatchesPredicate#test(Person)`, returning all clients that match any of the keywords.

#### Sequence diagram
The following diagram illustrates how the `find` command is processed when a user inputs `find alex 9223`.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `find` Command](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**  
The `ClientMatchesPredicate` instance (`p`) is created once and passed to both the `FindCommand` and `Model`.  
This design ensures predictable, stateless filtering and encapsulates all keyword-matching logic within a single class.
</div>

#### Example
| User Input       | Description                                                                    |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `find alex`      | Lists all clients whose name, phone, or email contains “alex”                  |
| `find alex 9223` | Lists all clients whose name, phone, or email contains either “alex” or “9223” |
| `find @gmail`    | Lists all clients with a Gmail address                                         |

#### Design considerations
**Aspect: Matching strategy**
* Use a single `ClientMatchesPredicate` that internally loops through keywords and fields.
    * Pros: Simpler to maintain, easy to test, less object overhead.

### Clear feature

Clear feature is implemented via `ClearCommand` class. When the user issues the `clear` command, an instance of `ClearCommand` is created and its `execute` method is called. This method interacts with the `Model` component to remove all entries from the address book. The `Model` provides a method `clearAddressBook()` which is invoked by the `ClearCommand` to perform the actual clearing of data. After clearing, a confirmation message is returned to inform the user that the address book has been successfully cleared.
When executed, the `ClearCommand` will save a copy of the current state of the address book to facilitate the undo feature.
![Clear Sequence Diagram](images/ClearCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

### Biz feature

Biz feature is implemented via `BizTagCommand` class. When the user inputs `biz f/Plan t/A t/B`, an instance of `BizTagCommand` is created and its `execute` method is called.
The object then creates a `FeatureTag` with `tagName` Plan and a `Set<Tag>` containing `Tag`s of `tagName`s A and B. It then passes the `FeatureTag` and `Set<Tag>` into `Model` via the `addBizTags()` method in `Model`.
The object then returns a `String` message to the user about the successful addition. If that Feature already exists in `Model`, this will overwrite that Feature : Tag pair. 

![Biz Sequence Diagram](images/BizSequenceDiagram.png)

### Unbiz feature

Unbiz feature is implemented via `BizUntagCommand` class. When the user inputs `unbiz f/Plan f/Gender`, an instance of `BizUntagCommand` is created and its `execute` method is called.
The object does the following:
* Check if the Feature after each `f/` exists in `Model` via the `isBizFeature()` method in `Model`. If there are Features that do not exist in `Model`, this command fails and tells the User which Features are missing.
* Else, for each Feature remove them and their Tags from `Model` via the `removeBizFeature()` method in `Model`. Then it returns to the User a `String` confirmation of the removal operation done with which Feature and Tags pair have been removed.

The implementation of the feature is atomic - either all inputted Features get removed or none gets removed. Hence, reducing unexpected changes to the `bizTags` structure in `Model`.
![Biz Sequence Diagram](images/UnbizSequenceDiagram.png)

### Stats feature

Stats feature in implemented via the `StatsCommand` class. When the user issues the `stats` command, an instance of `StatsCommand` is created and its `execute` method is called. This method interacts with the `Model` component to obtain declared Features and their respective Tags from `bizTags` using the `get_BizTags()` method in `Model`. It will then aggregate statistics such as Average, Min and Max for each Feature using its own `getFeatureStats()` method and return the output as a `String` through the `CommandResult` object.
This feature is not undoable.
![Stats_Sequence_Diagram](images/StatsSequenceDiagram.png)

### Undo/redo feature
 
Undo and redo features are implemented using the Command Pattern along with a stack-based approach to track executed commands. Each command that modifies the state of the address book (e.g., add, delete, edit) implements an `undo()` and `redo()` method.

When a mutable command is executed, it is pushed onto an `undoStack`. 
If the user issues an `undo` command, the most recent command is popped from the `undoStack`, its `undo()` method is called to revert the changes, and it is then pushed onto a `redoStack`. 
Conversely, when a `redo` command is issued, the most recent command from the `redoStack` is popped, its `execute(m)` method is called to reapply the changes, and it is pushed back onto the `undoStack`.

The `undo` function in a command will do the opposite of what the `execute` function does.
For example, the `undo` function for the `ClearCommand` will restore all previously deleted entries back into the address book.

Using clear command as an example, the sequence diagram below illustrates how the `undo` feature works:
![Undo Clear Sequence Diagram](images/UndoCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

Using clear command as an example, the sequence diagram below illustrates how the `redo` command works after an `undo` of the clear command has been executed:
![Undo Clear Sequence Diagram](images/RedoCommandSequenceDiagram.png)
